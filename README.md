Projects to obtain the Responsive Web Design Certification

After Completing the five web programming projects, I will be allowed to earn my Responsive Web Design certification. By working on those projects, I got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles and concepts I have learned so far in freecodecamp.org. 

Working on this project I also learned the difference between 'syntax errors' and 'logic errors' and how to debug the HTML and CSS and be sure that they are well-formed.
The total hours of this course, are 300 hours.

Note: Despite I had spent 300 hours on this course, I have been doing additional study hours to improve the skills acquired.
