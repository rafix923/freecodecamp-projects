Projects to obtain the Responsive Web Design Certification

All five projects were required to use HTML and CSS only.

After Completing the five web programming projects, I will be allowed to earn my Responsive Web Design certification. By working on those projects, I got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles and concepts I have learned so far in freecodecamp.org. 

The curriculum of this course  are: 

1- Basic HTML and HTML5 

2- Basic CSS 

3- Applied Visual Design 

4- Applied Accessibility 

5- Responsive Web Design Principles

Working on this project I also learned the difference between 'syntax errors' and 'logic errors' and how to debug the HTML and CSS and be sure that they are well-formed.
The total hours of this course, are 300 hours.

Note: Despite I had spent 300 hours on this course, I have been doing additional study hours to improve the skills acquired. 

I hope you enjoy it!
