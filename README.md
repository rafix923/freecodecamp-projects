Projects to obtain the Responsive Web Design Certification:

1 - Tribute Page

2 - Survey Form

3 - Product Landing Page

4 - Technical Documentation Page

5 - Personal Portfolio Webpage

All five projects are required to use HTML and CSS only.

Working on these projects, I got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles and concepts I have learned so far in freecodecamp.org. 

The curriculum of this course is: 

- Basic HTML and HTML5 

- Basic CSS 

- Applied Visual Design 

- Applied Accessibility

- Responsive Web Design Principles

The total hours of this curriculum are 300 hours.

Even though the total hours of this curriculum are 300 hrs, I have been spending additional hours of studies to improve the skills acquired. 

If you wish to give me some feedback to keep improving it, I would appreciate it.

Good Codes!
