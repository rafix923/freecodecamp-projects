Task 01 of 05 for Responsive Web Design certification. 

After completing the five web programming projects, I will be allowed to earn the Responsive Web Design certification. 

Working on this project, I got a chance to apply all of the skills, principles and concepts I have learned so far in freecodecamp.org. 

I also learned the difference between 'syntax errors' and 'logic errors' and how to debug the HTML and CSS to guarantee they are well-formed.

After completing my tribute page, I checked the markup by running my HTML page through the Markup Validation Service at: https://validator.w3.org/.
