Task 01 of 05 for Responsive Web Design certification. 

By working on this project,  I learned the difference between 'syntax errors' and 'logic errors' and how to debug the HTML and CSS to be sure that they are well-formed.

I checked the markup by running my HTML page through the Markup Validation Service at https://validator.w3.org/.
