## Project 02 of 05 for Responsive Web Design Certification

### Build a Product Landing Page

To accomplish this challenge, I had to fulfill the following user stories:

* User Story #1: Your product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

* User Story #2: You can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img" (A logo would make a good image here).

* User Story #3: Within the #header element, you can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

* User Story #4: You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

* User Story #5: When you click a .nav-link button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

* User Story #6: You can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

* User Story #7: Your landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

* User Story #8: Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where you can enter an email address.

* User Story #9: The #email input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for.

* User Story #10: The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

* User Story #11: Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

* User Story #12: When you click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit). 

* User Story #13: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

* User Story #14: Your product landing page should have at least one media query.

* User Story #15: Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

I checked the markup by running the HTML page through the Markup Validation Service at https://validator.w3.org/.
