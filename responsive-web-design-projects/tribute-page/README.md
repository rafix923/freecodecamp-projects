Task 01 of 05 for Responsive Web Design certification.

- Build a  tribute page 

This tribute page relies on the works of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., The man who contributed significantly to civil rights in America as well as the world.  

Working on this project, I learned the difference between 'syntax errors' and 'logic errors' and how to debug the HTML and CSS and guarantee that they are well-formed.

I checked the markup by running the HTML page through the Markup Validation Service at https://validator.w3.org/.
