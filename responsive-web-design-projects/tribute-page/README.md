##  Project 01 of 05 for Responsive Web Design Certification

###  Build a  Tribute Page 

To accomplish this challenge, I had to fulfill the following *user stories*:

* User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

* User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

* User Story #3: I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

* User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

* User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

* User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

* User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

* User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

* User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.


This tribute page relies on the works of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., The man who contributed significantly to civil rights in America as well as the world.  

Working on this project, I learned the difference between 'syntax errors' and 'logic errors' and how to debug the HTML and CSS and guarantee that they are well-formed.

I checked the markup by running the HTML page through the Markup Validation Service at https://validator.w3.org/.
